      <h1>Jordan XI</h1>
      <img src="Jordan X1 black.webp" height="400" width="600" alt="Jordan 11's black and white"> <p>These fly sneakers are the black and white Jordan 11's which came out in the 90s and have been released as the retros. The 11's originally were dropped the same year Micheal Jordan announced that he was going to return back to the NBA. Throughout his 1995-96 season Micheal Jordan wore these 11's as a symbol of his return to the NBA. In addition,Its mesh upper provided more durability than the average sneaker, and the patent leather gave the model structure while still providing the necessary lightness. Conveniently, the mix of smooth lines and wavy leather on the simple silhouette made it perfect for dressing up or down.   </p>

      <h1>Jordan 5 retros</h1>
<img src="Jordan 5 retros.webp" height="400" width="600" alt="Retro Jordan 5's worn by will smith"> <p>These comfortable, fresh sneakers are the Jordan 11's which again were worn by will smith. These sneakers are stylish and are comfortable when playing basketball. The sporty look combined with a street wear/dope look makes for a good style. Fun Fact, The designâ€™s clearest tribute to the sitcom can be found on the insole, where Air Jordan branding appears in the same graffiti-style as the shows title sequence.</p>
